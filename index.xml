      <description>This is another of those attempts we think that will last for a long time, but has a huge potential of happening only once and never again. Anyway, here we go.
One PEP a Week will be a personal project in which every week I&amp;rsquo;ll review one PEP that I find relevant, give some opinions on it and, hopefully, learn a lot. Please note that these posts will be filled with opinions and potential mistakes, so be kind on the feedbacks.</description>
