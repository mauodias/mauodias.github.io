      <description>One of the biggest concerns of reasonably large projects and applications is the management of secrets. We have them laying everywhere, and there&amp;rsquo;s not much to do about it. We may need access tokens, passwords, credentials and much more. How should we handle those secrets? What is the best way to move such data around, to store them and to use, without chances of leaking by accident (or even intentionally) and, if such an incident happens, what are good ways to minimize the damage?</description>
